# Security Policy

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The FluffySwap team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@fluffyswap.dev**

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and verified

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

#### Implemented Protections
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Owner-only administrative functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Integer Overflow Protection**: Solidity 0.8+ built-in protection
- **External Call Safety**: Proper error handling for external calls

#### Security Patterns Used
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: State changes before external calls
- **Pull over Push**: Users withdraw rather than automatic transfers
- **Rate Limiting**: Minimum and maximum swap amounts
- **Emergency Stops**: Owner can pause contract if needed

#### Audit Status
- **Internal Review**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **External Audit**: üîÑ Planned for v2.0
- **Bug Bounty**: üîÑ Planned for mainnet deployment

### Frontend Security

#### Implemented Protections
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper data encoding and CSP headers
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data protection
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **Content Security Policy**: XSS mitigation

#### Security Headers
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Infrastructure Security

#### Deployment Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections encrypted
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers implemented
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies kept up-to-date
- **Access Control**: Limited deployment access
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs validated
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security logging

## üîç Known Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Risks

#### Centralization Risks
- **Owner Privileges**: Contract owner can update rates and withdraw funds
- **Mitigation**: Multi-sig wallet planned for production
- **Transparency**: All owner actions are logged via events

#### Economic Risks
- **Price Manipulation**: Fixed exchange rate (not market-based)
- **Liquidity Risk**: Limited by contract token balance
- **Mitigation**: Rate updates are owner-controlled and logged

#### Technical Risks
- **Gas Limit**: Large swaps may hit gas limits
- **Network Congestion**: High gas prices during network congestion
- **Mitigation**: Swap limits and gas estimation

### Frontend Risks

#### Wallet Security
- **Private Key Exposure**: Users responsible for wallet security
- **Phishing**: Users must verify correct website URL
- **Mitigation**: Clear security warnings and education

#### Network Risks
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: HTTPS protects against MITM attacks
- **DNS Hijacking**: Use bookmarks or type URL directly
- **Mitigation**: HTTPS, HSTS, and security headers

## üö® Incident Response

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- **Definition**: Immediate threat to user funds or data
- **Response Time**: < 1 hour
- **Actions**: Immediate investigation, potential emergency pause

#### High (P1)
- **Definition**: Significant security vulnerability
- **Response Time**: < 4 hours
- **Actions**: Rapid investigation and fix development

#### Medium (P2)

2. **Pause Contract**: If necessary, pause contract operations
3. **Notify Users**: Immediate communication via all channels
4. **Investigate**: Detailed analysis of the issue
5. **Fix Development**: Rapid fix development and testing
6. **Deployment**: Careful deployment with verification
7. **Resume Operations**: Gradual resumption of services
8. **Post-Mortem**: Detailed analysis and prevention measures

#### Frontend Emergency

2. **Notify Users**: Clear communication about the issue
3. **Investigate**: Identify root cause
4. **Fix and Test**: Develop and test fix
5. **Deploy Fix**: Careful deployment
6. **Monitor**: Enhanced monitoring post-fix

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security
- **Use Hardware Wallets**: For large amounts
