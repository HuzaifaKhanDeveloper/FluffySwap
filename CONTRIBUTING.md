# Contributing to FluffySwap

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FluffySwap! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Solidity
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fluffyswap.git`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Copy environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
5. Configure your `.env` file with required API keys
6. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **TypeScript**: All new code must be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Use Prettier for code formatting
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components

### Component Structure
```typescript
// Component template
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define props with proper types
}

export const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ 
  // Destructure props
}) => {
  // Component logic

  return (
    <motion.div
      // Framer Motion animations
      className="component-styles"
    >
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </motion.div>
  );
};
```

### Smart Contract Guidelines
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts for security
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed NatSpec documentation
- Follow Solidity style guide
- Include unit tests for all functions

### Git Workflow
1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
3. Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/FluffySwap.test.ts

# Run frontend tests
npm run test:frontend
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Use descriptive test names
- Maintain >90% test coverage

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('Component/Function Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle error cases', () => {
    // Error testing
  });
});
```

## üé® Design Guidelines

### UI/UX Principles
- **Kawaii Aesthetic**: Maintain cute, friendly design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Performance**: Smooth animations and interactions
- **Consistency**: Follow established design patterns

### Color Usage
- Use the established kawaii color palette
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Support both light and dark themes
- Use semantic colors for states (success, error, warning)

### Animation Guidelines
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Keep animations smooth and purposeful
- Respect user's motion preferences
- Use consistent timing and easing

## üîí Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- Never use `tx.origin` for authorization
- Implement proper access controls
- Use ReentrancyGuard for state-changing functions
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Follow checks-effects-interactions pattern

### Frontend Security
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Validate data from external sources

### Private Key Management
- Never commit private keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use hardware wallets for production deployments

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions
- Include usage examples
- Document complex logic
- Keep README.md updated

### API Documentation
- Document all contract functions
- Include parameter descriptions
- Provide usage examples
- Document error conditions
